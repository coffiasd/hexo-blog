## 1.Attacker can reenter to mint all the collection supply
when mint ERC721 token,protocol invoke minter's `onERC721Received` function can lead to re-entrancy issue.

## 2.Attacker can drain all ETH from AuctionDemo when block.timestamp == auctionEndTime 

## 3.Adversary can block claimAuction() due to push-strategy to transfer assets to multiple bidders
claimAuction() implements a push-strategy instead of a pull-strategy for returning the bidders funds.
protocol invoke user's address to send eth,user can implement revert on receive{} function to brick the process.

## 4.Multiple mints can brick any form of salesOption 3 mintings
```solidity
lastMintDate[col] = collectionPhases[col].allowlistStartTime
                + (collectionPhases[col].timePeriod * (gencore.viewCirSupply(col) - 1));
```
due to mint at different period , first mint period extend time result in lastMintDate bigger than second period's start time.

## 5.MinterContract::payArtist can result in double the intended payout
inconsistent between set percent and calculate acturally pay out.
