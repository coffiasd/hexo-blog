## 1.The calculation of released in config function of RewardsController is wrong
**summary**
```solidity
rewardData.lastConfig = uint32(block.timestamp);
...
released =
    rewardData.lastConfigReleased + rewardData.releaseRate * (block.timestamp - rewardData.lastConfig);
```
As we can see, the protocol uses the time period from `lastConfig` to the present to calculate the released amount. However, consider a scenario where the start time is set in the future.

**root cause**
protocol assume start time is equal to the configuration time.

## 2.Expired maturities longer than FixedLib.INTERVAL with unaccrued earnings may be arbitraged and/or might lead to significant bad debt creation
**summary**
```solidity
>     uint256 latestMaturity = block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL);
>     uint256 maxMaturity = latestMaturity + maxFuturePools * FixedLib.INTERVAL;

      for (uint256 maturity = latestMaturity; maturity <= maxMaturity; maturity += FixedLib.INTERVAL) {
        FixedLib.Pool storage pool = fixedPools[maturity];
        uint256 lastAccrual = pool.lastAccrual;

        if (maturity > lastAccrual) {
          backupEarnings += block.timestamp < maturity
            ? pool.unassignedEarnings.mulDivDown(block.timestamp - lastAccrual, maturity - lastAccrual)
            : pool.unassignedEarnings;
        }
      }
```
when calculate `latestMaturity` use `block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL)` which can lead to a replay more than 1 INTERVAL not accounted.
**root cause**
`block.timestamp - (block.timestamp % FixedLib.INTERVAL)` has a time range.
