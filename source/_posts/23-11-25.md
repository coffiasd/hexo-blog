## 1.check contract exist using bytes32(0)
    <address>.codehash != bytes32(0) check is insufficient to determine if an address has existing code
    An account is considered empty when it has no code and zero nonce and zero balance.
    if anyone transfers 1 wei to an address, .codehash will return keccak256("") instead of bytes32(0)

    Fix for this is easier than suggested - just change from x.codehash != bytes32(0) to x.code.length != 0

## 2.Borrower has no way to update maxTotalSupply of market or close market
    Developer define a function but no way to interact with it

## 3.When withdrawalBatchDuration is set to zero lenders can withdraw more then allocated to a batch
    wirte a full test 

## 4.Any address can withdraw from markets contrary
    function access control

## 5.Borrower can drain all funds of a sanctioned lender
    missmatched parmeters in different functions.
