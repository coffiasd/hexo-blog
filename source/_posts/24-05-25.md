# How does blast l2 receive and claim ETH yield

## 1.overview
One of the key differences between Blast L2 and other Layer 2 solutions is that in Blast L2, ETH functions as a native rebasing token.

### 1.1 what is rebasing token?
 A rebasing token in the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) context is a type of cryptocurrency whose supply automatically adjusts, or `rebases` periodically to maintain a target price or peg. This mechanism is designed to achieve certain economic goals, such as price stability or controlled inflation/deflation.
### 1.2 why blast l2 ?
- Blast users and smart contracts can earn ~4% from beacon chain staking yield
- Blast redirects sequencer fees to the dapps that induced them

## 2.three options for yield modes
Smart contract must interact with `0x4300000000000000000000000000000000000002` to change their gas mode.

### 2.1 Void (DEFAULT)
Void is default yield modes for smart contract which deploy on blast l2. The balance of smart contract never changes, no yield is earned . Any normal dapp can be deploy on blast without any changes.
Thus if you already have smart contract you can just move it to blast.

### 2.2 Automatic
Since eth is native rebasing on blast l2 , if deposit 1 eth into smart contract, the contract's balance will grow to 1.04 ETH in a year. 

### 2.3 Claimable
For claimable mode, if deposit 1 eth into smart contract , the contract's balance will emain at 1 eth even after a year. We can implement two functions to claim yield:
- claimYield
- claimAllYield

```solidity
interface IBlast{
    // See IBlast interface source code below
}

contract MyContract {
	constructor() {
		IBlast(0x43...02).configureClaimableYield()
	}

	function claimYield(address recipient, uint256 amount) external {
	  //This function is public meaning anyone can claim the yield
		IBlast(0x43...02).claimYield(address(this), recipient, amount);
  }

	function claimAllYield(address recipient) external {
	  //This function is public meaning anyone can claim the yield
		IBlast(0x43...02).claimAllYield(address(this), recipient);
  }
}
```
