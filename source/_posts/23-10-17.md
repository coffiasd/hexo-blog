## 1.protocol use CREATE3 that's not avaliable in the Zksync Era.

## 2.two modifer not cover block.timestamp == allocationEndTime.

```solidity
    function _checkOnlyActiveAllocation() internal view {
        if (allocationStartTime > block.timestamp || block.timestamp > allocationEndTime) {
            revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ACTIVE();
        }
    }

    /// @notice Checks if the allocation has ended and reverts if not.
    /// @dev This will revert if the allocation has not ended.
    function _checkOnlyAfterAllocation() internal view {
        if (block.timestamp < allocationEndTime) {
            revert ALLOCATION_NOT_ENDED();
        }
    }
```
When block.timestamp == allocationEndTime none of above modifers revert.
