## 1.DAO unable to withdraw their funds due to Convex admin action

### summary
The administrator can cause a DoS (Denial of Service) in the protocol by passing malicious parameters
### root cause
according to docs : admin's  action is `RESTRICTED`
### learned
When a role's behavior is RESTRICTED, it is necessary to examine the consequences of any suspicious actions

## 2.Inadequate Allowance Handling in convertAndForward Function of OCT_DAO & OCT_YDL
### summary
stricted allowance assertion check lead to transaction failed
### root cause
protocol suffers from inadequate handling of token allowances for the 1inch router,however they are not reset afterward.
### learned
take care of the allowance assertion check

## 3.cannot forward extra rewards from both OCY_Convex to OCT_YDL
### summary
```diff
-               if (rewardAmount > 0) { IERC20(rewardContract).safeTransfer(OCT_YDL, rewardAmount); }
+               if (rewardAmount > 0) { IBaseRewardPool_OCY_Convex_C(rewardContract).rewardToken().safeTransfer(OCT_YDL, rewardAmount); }
```
### root cause
use `safeTransfer` in a none erc20 contract
### learned


## 4.ZivoeYDL::earningsTrancheuse() always assumes that daysBetweenDistributions have passed, which might not be the case

### summary
The protocol relies on keepers to call `distributeYield`. However, there is no guarantee that the keeper will make the call immediately.
### root cause
The calculation of the APY depends on `block.timestamp`.
### learned
When the calculation of APY depends on the timestamp, ensure it is called immediately

## 5.ZivoeYDL::distributeYield yield distribution is flash-loan manipulatable

### summary
`distributeYield` is depends on `totalSupply`, however `totalSupply` can be manipulable through a flashloan.A 1-transaction inflated staked amount allows to inflate stakers distribution at the loss of vesters distribution

### root cause
`distributeYield` amount is calculated with `totalSupply`

## 6.distributeYield() calls earningsTrancheuse() with outdated emaSTT & emaJTT while calculating senior & junior tranche yield distributions
### summary
The `earningsTrancheuse` function uses `emaSTT` and `emaJTT` to calculate earnings, and then updates the latest `emaSTT` and `emaJTT`. It is recommended to update the latest values first and then use them to calculate earnings.

### root cause
the value is not lastest need to be updated.

## 7.User cannot withdraw stakingToken due to incorrect calculation of _totalSupply
### summary
When the user revokes a stake, the total amount is subtracted instead of the currently withdrawable amount, leading to an overflow DoS.

### root cause
logic error
