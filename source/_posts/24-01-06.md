## 0.learned from this contest
- use selfdestruct can send eth to any contract,even contract not implement `receive{}`

## 1.Bidder can use donations to get VerbsToken from auction that already ended.
protocol use `address(this).balance` to check if bid amount is bigger than current eth value in contract , attacker can send eth to protocol to bypass above check.
need to take care of `address(this).balance` check.

## 2.Incorrect amounts of ETH are transferred to the DAO treasury in ERC20TokenEmitter::buyToken(), causing a value leak in every transaction
need to track eth

## 3.VerbsToken.tokenURI() is vulnerable to JSON injection attacks

## 4.encodedData argument of hashStruct is not calculated perfectly for EIP712 singed messages in CultureIndex.sol
>hashStruct(s : 𝕊) = keccak256(typeHash ‖ encodeData(s))

## 5.ERC20TokenEmitter::buyToken function mints more tokens to users than it should do


## 6.Anyone can pause AuctionHouse in _createAuction #195
when mint revert the protocol gonna be paused,attacker can use specific amount of gas to send transaction which can lead to transaction OOG.
