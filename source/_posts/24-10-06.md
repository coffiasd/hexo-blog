# How to use AI to summarize documents and generate flowcharts in minutes ?

## Transform an online GitBook document into Markdown using a Python script

Jump to github url <https://github.com/A2-Security/GitBook-Scraper>
Clone repo using the following command
```shell
git@github.com:A2-Security/GitBook-Scraper.git
```

### Ensure that you have the following installed
- Python 3.x
- Python packages: requests, beautifulsoup4, html2text

Let's take zerolend project as example, the official document url is <https://docs.zerolend.xyz>. 

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    gitbook_url = 'https://docs.zerolend.xyz'  # Replace with the GitBook URL
    output_file = 'documentation.md'  # Desired output markdown file

    main(gitbook_url, output_file)
```

Replace above official document url to whatever you need.After modify it to your own url, run the following python script.

```shell
python3 gitbook_scraper.py
```

After successlly execute the python script you'll see the `documentation.md` on your root directory.

## Feed the markdown file to AI
Let's take `claude.ai`  as example.

Copy the generated flowchart to online mermaid website.

## Why we need this ?
As we know, Web3 security competitions are time-limited. Participants who grasp the entire system quickly gain an advantage in identifying more vulnerabilities. With the help of AI we can generate flowchart in minitues. Furthermore, we have a summary of the entire project. I'm not entirely convinced that AI will replace auditors in the near future, but I am certain that those who donâ€™t utilize AI will be left behind.
