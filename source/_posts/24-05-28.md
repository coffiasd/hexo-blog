# High Risk

## 1.SettleLongPremium is incorrectly implemented: premium should be deducted instead of added
### summary
```solidity
            // current available assets belonging to PLPs (updated after settlement) excluding any premium paid
            int256 updatedAssets = int256(uint256(s_poolAssets)) - swappedAmount;

            // add premium to be paid/collected on position close
>           int256 tokenToPay = -realizedPremium;
```
In the code, the `int` type is used for numbers, and the sign of the subtrahend is used to control whether the final result is an increase or a decrease.
### root cause
As a result, an error in the sign of the input parameters leads to the final operation being contrary to the expectation.
### learned
When we use the `int` type, we need to pay special attention to the sign of the values
## 2.
### summary
```solidity
unchecked {
    assets = Math.mulDivRoundingUp(
        shares * DECIMALS,
        totalAssets(),
        totalSupply * (DECIMALS - COMMISSION_FEE)
    );
}
```
unchecked block can lead to silent overflow
### root cause
Due to user can mint huge amounts of shares for free the shares can be much greater than expected.
### learned
Double check the unchecked block make sure it can't overflow.

# Medium Risk

## 1.PanopticFactory uses spot price when deploying new pools, resulting in liquidity manipulation when minting
### summary
```solidity
@>	(uint160 currentSqrtPriceX96, , , , , , ) = v3Pool.slot0();
```
When deployNewPool is called it uses the spot price of the pool, which can be manipulated through a flashloan and thus could return a highly inaccurate result.
### root cause
uses spot price
### learned
spot price can be manipulated through a flashloan, try to use TWAP price instead.

## 2._validatePositionList() does not check for duplicate tokenIds, allowing attackers to bypass solvency checks
### summary
The user can pass in an array of `tokenIds`, but there is no check for duplicates.
### root cause
no check for duplicates
### learned
Think about if pass in array need to be checked for duplicates.
## 3.Removed liquidity can overflow when calling SemiFungiblePositionManager.mintTokenizedPosition function
### summary
```solidity
if (!isBurn) {
    // we can't remove more liquidity than we add in the first place, so this can't overflow
    unchecked {
        removedLiquidity += chunkLiquidity;
    }
}
```
options can be repeatly which can lead to removedLiquidity sum up mutiple times.
### root cause
unchecked block overflow
### learned
need to double check the unchecked block make sure it can not be overflow

## 4.Wrong leg chunkKey calculation in haircutPremia function
### summary
when loop tokenId , uses always the index 0 when calculating the leg chunkKey instead of using the actual leg index 
### root cause
logic error
### learned
pay more attention to the logic.
## 5.Panoptic pool can be non-profitable by specific Uniswap governance
### summary
The developers only considered the current range of Uniswap fees, but these fees may change through governance, affecting the existing logic.
### root cause
fee may changes in the future.
### learned
It is necessary to consider the impact of governance on the current fees.
