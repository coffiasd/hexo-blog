## 1.getBunniTokenPrice wrongly returns the total price of all tokens
    The function getBunniTokenPrice() is supposed to return the price of 1 Bunni token (1 share) like all other feeds, but it doesn't. It returns the total price of all minted tokens/shares for a specific pool (total value of position's reserves) which is wrong.

## 2.Possible incorrect price for tokens in Balancer stable pool due to amplification parameter update

## 3.Incorrect StablePool BPT price calculation
    `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm` is in scope , but any user can invoke deposit to add assets, deposit is not in scope.need to check those out of scope functions.

## 4.getReservesByCategory() when useSubmodules =true and submoduleReservesSelector=bytes4(0) will revert
    when add not check parameters lead to some category can't get Reserves

## 5.Price calculation can be manipulated by intentionally reverting some of price feeds
    when use uniswap and balancer to calculate price, both price feed can revert due to re-enter lead to user can manipulate price.
